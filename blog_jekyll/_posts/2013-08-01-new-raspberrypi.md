I recently bought a Raspberry Pi Model B from [Newark](http://www.newark.com/jsp/bespoke/bespoke7.jsp?bespokepage=newark/en_US/landing/raspberry-pi/rasp-pi-accessories.jsp "Newark"). I had spent some time last summer delving in the microcontroller world and was excited to play with the raspberry pi, specifically with the GPIO.

My purchase consisted of the following:

-   RaspberryPi Model B
-   Clear Enclosure
-   4GB SD Card
-   Pi Face expansion card
-   PiWifi
-   LED 8x8 Dot Matrix (x2)
-   Potentiometer Slide (x10)
-   Micro USB cable


I waited patiently for my new found joy to arrive and went crazy when it did. The RaspberryPi opens up so many new development opportunities and makes it easy to transgress the barrier between software and hardware.
