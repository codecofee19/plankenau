Since, I've [switched](http://plankenau.com/blog/post-9/awesome-wm) to Awesome WM, I've been meaning to find a way to lock my X session.

What I want
-------------

I have an HTC One running ParanoidAndroid and one of my favorite features is the ability to set your lock screen wallpaper as a blurred see-through view of the
underlying screen: this is exactly what I wanted to emulate.

What I needed
-------------

1. i3lock
2. scrot
3. imagemagick
4. xautolock

All four of these can be installed on Ubuntu through apt-get via

    sudo apt-get install i3lock scrot imagemagick xautolock

How I did it
-----------

The way I approached this is by using scrot to take a screenshot, then use imagemagick to apply a Gaussian blur, finally run i3lock using the modified image
as the background.

Create a new file `/bin/lock` (you'll need sudo to write) that contains


    #!/bin/bash
    scrot /tmp/screenshot.png
    convert /tmp/screenshot.png -blur 0x5 /tmp/screenshotblur.png
    i3lock -i /tmp/screenshotblur.png

The first line takes a screenshot. The second line applies a Gaussian blur, the parameter is bias x radius, this what I liked but feel free to change it (note: the larger the radius, the longer it will take to process).
The third line actually activates the lock screen.

Save the file and mark it as executable

    sudo chmod +x /bin/lock

You can now run `lock` from bash to activate your brand new lock screen!

Autolock
--------

This is great, but it's useless unless our computer locks after inactivity. For this, I used xautolock that does just that.
Add the following line wherever you keep your startup scripts (rc.lua, .bashrc, .xsessionrc, etc...)

    xautolock -time 10 -locker lock

The first parameter denotes how long to wait, in minutes, before showing the lock screen and can range from 1 to 60.
The second parameter is what to run, which should obviously be our new executable.

That's it
---------

Looks pretty awesome huh?

Some further notes: i3lock has some other parameters you might want mess around with, check `man i3lock`

Even better note: [shiver](http://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/23w51d/archi3_i3lock_fork_with_builtin_blur_option/) made an [awesome fork](https://github.com/shiver/i3lock) of i3lock that includes a flag for blurring a screenshot of your desktop with no extra
dependencies or writing to files, I definitely recommend it too (especially if you're running arch as the PKGBUILD is [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shiver/AUR/master/i3lock-shiver-git/PKGBUILD)).
